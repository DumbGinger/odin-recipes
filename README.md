This current project I will be making a basic bare bones website for recipes. 

It will test all of my current skills I have learned throughout the odin 
project. 

I will practice things like: 

>making a boilerplate
>utilizing images and links
>and practicing my indentions to create easier to read code

Plus anything else that is required.
