    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Tikka Masala is a delicious dish of spices and yogurt based sauce, with chunks of juicy chicken, all served over rice.
        It's a dish of indian origin, and one of the best things about it is that a lot of ingredients can be found in your kitchen.
        It has a garlic spice infused taste that is uniquely delicious.
        Marinating the chicken overnight will produce better results, and it can be made in a pot or a skillet.
