    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chile Verde is a latin chili dish commonly made of green chile peppers and tomatillos, with pork or chicken. Usually slow cooked and bursting with flavor, chile verde (green chile) is a very simple dish with lots of depth to its flavor. Due to the nature of slow cooked meals like this, it may take prep time to make.
        That doesn't mean it isn't worth the time investment though, Chile Verde is an amazing dish and can be prepared in many ways. It can but used as a topping, an additive to a burritos filling, or just served plain in a bowl!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces tomatillos</li>
        <li>3 jalapenos</li>
        <li>2 large poblano peppers</li>
        <li>1 serrano pepper</li>
        <li>2 medium onions</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds pork shoulder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spray a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or grease with oil. Place the tomatillos, jalapenos, poblanos and serrano peppers on the baking sheet and place under broiler. Broil on high for 10 minutes, turning the tomatillos and peppers over halfway through.</li>
        <li>Remove the baking sheet from the broiler and cover with aluminum foil or plastic wrap. Let it sit for 10 minutes. Uncover and remove as much of the skin from the peppers as you can. At this point, you can also remove the seeds from any of the peppers if you don't want it too spicy. </li>
        <li>Add the broiled tomatillos, peppers, onions and garlic into a large blender. Blend until smooth. Set aside until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add in the cooking oil and then the pork. Season generously with salt and pepper. Sear the meat on all sides until nicely browned.</li>
        <li>Add the prepared chile verde and mix thoroughly, making sure to scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon so you get all the brown bits. Cover, lower the heat to simmer and cook for 2 to 3 hours, until the pork is tender.</li>
        <li>Add the water, lime juice and cilantro. Stir until combined. Taste and season with more salt, if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
